# Django Project Setup with Pipenv

This guide walks you through setting up a Django project using **Pipenv** for managing your dependencies in a virtual environment.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Python** (version 3.6 or higher): [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **Pip** (Python's package installer): [Install pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)
- **Pipenv**: A tool for managing Python dependencies in isolated environments.

## 1. Install Pipenv

If you haven't installed **Pipenv** already, you can install it globally using **pip**:

```bash
pip install pipenv
```

## 2. Create a Virtual Environment

Navigate to your project folder (or create a new one) and create a Pipenv environment for managing your dependencies.

```bash
mkdir my-django-project
cd my-django-project
pipenv install
```

This will create a virtual environment and a Pipfile in your project directory.

## 3. Install Django

To install Django in the Pipenv virtual environment, use the following command:
```bash
pipenv install django
```

This will install the latest version of Django and add it to your Pipfile


## 4. Start a New Django Project

Once Django is installed, you can start a new Django project using the django-admin tool. Replace myproject with your desired project name:

```bash
pipenv run django-admin startproject myproject
cd myproject
```
This creates a new Django project with a basic structure.

## 5. Set Up the Database

Before you can start the development server, you need to apply the initial migrations. Run the following command to set up the database:

```bash
pipenv run python manage.py migrate
```

This will create the necessary database tables for your Django project.

## 6. Create a Superuser

To access the Django admin panel, you'll need to create a superuser. Run the following command and follow the prompts:

```bash
pipenv run python manage.py createsuperuser
```

This will allow you to create a user with admin privileges for logging into the Django admin interface.

## 7. Run the Django Development Server

Start the development server using:

```bash
pipenv run python manage.py runserver
```

You should now be able to access your Django application by navigating to:
``` bash
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```
And the admin interface can be accessed at:
```bash
http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin
```
Log in with the superuser credentials you created earlier.

## 8. Deactivate the Virtual Environment

Once youâ€™re done working, you can deactivate the virtual environment by running:

```bash
exit
```
This will return you to your system's global Python environment.

## 9. Install Dependencies from Pipfile

If you're working on this project with others or you need to set up the environment again, you can install all the dependencies specified in the Pipfile by running:

```bash
pipenv install
```
This will recreate the virtual environment and install all the necessary dependencies.
